# Custom Input

Formalite can connect and and validate your custom input outside of Formalite object

we can place custom component two place:
* Inside of Formalite
* Outside of Formalite

### Inside of Formalite

Its same as Outside of Formalite just need add CustomComponent inside `render` in `ComponentView`, with that you can put your input any were

<Canvas>
  <Story
    style={{width:"100%"}} 
    name="Inside of Formalite"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { 
        code: InsideComponentCode,
        language: "javascript",
        type: "auto"
      }} 
    }}>
    <InsideComponent/>
  </Story>
</Canvas> 

### Outside of Formalite

For example: we can add Rating view with not included in Formalite added after Formalite form and when form submitted this rating and get validated and submitted with Formalite form

##### Example:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    style={{width:"100%"}} 
    name="Outside of Formalite"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { 
        code: OutsideComponentCode,
        language: "javascript",
